# WSN-Battery-vs-Topology-Simulation
This simulation program can be used to find the most suitable topolgy for most wireless sensor network applications.         
Information co9llected includes:         
  average packet generation/s 
  real time relation to animation time
  battery capacitance
  rate at which clusterhead is chosen
  distributions of data rate (poisson vs. fixed)
  battery depleted for on time/transmission/clustterhead transmission
  battery depleted for overhead
  whether graph is weighted or not
  statistics on length of time network lasted
  first node to die
  last node to die
  when each node died or just a percentage still alive
