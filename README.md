# WSN-Battery-vs-Topology-Simulation
This simulation program can be used to find the most suitable topolgy for most wireless sensor network applications.         
Information collected includes:         
  average packet generation/s,  
  real time relation to animation time, 
  battery capacitance, 
  rate at which clusterhead is chosen, 
  distributions of data rate (poisson vs. fixed), 
  battery depleted for on time/transmission/clustterhead transmission, 
  battery depleted for overhead, 
  whether graph is weighted or not, 
  statistics on length of time network lasted, 
  first node to die, 
  last node to die, 
  when each node died or just a percentage still alive
